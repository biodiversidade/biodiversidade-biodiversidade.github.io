Dan Boskovich defends Noah's ark:
> There has been great diversification within species in the last
> 5000 years....
> For example, the wild rock pigeon has diversified into several strains
> such as the pouter, the leghorn runt, the fantail, the tumbler, the owl,
> the turbit, the swallow, the carrier, the nun, the jacobin, and the
> homer.

Isn't this somewhat akin to evolution?  Or is "diversification" different?
